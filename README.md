# loteria

## About

Loteria is a very popular game in Latin America. Growing up, we would use little stones or grab
raw black beans as the way to mark which cards had been called. Some choose to cover the board
with the selected marker and remove one pebble every time there was a match. Others would add 
a market everytime there was a match.


## Goal
I want to create a virtual version of Loteria as a way to practice some new skills and to use
it as an opportunity to play a beloved board game with family across the world.


## Requirements

### MVP

- A single concurrent game is happening
- There are boards with 16 unique images in each
- There is a deck of 54 unique cards tht is called during the game
- Each player can select a board at the beginning of the game
- As cards are "called" they are added to a discard pile
- Players do not have a way to mark their boards but once their board is filled, a congratulatory
message will appear naming them the winner
- The game can be reset at the end
